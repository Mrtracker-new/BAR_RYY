"""
Hey! This is the CLIENT-SIDE storage module 📥

This handles .bar files that users download and keep on their own computers.
Since they have the file, we can't really stop them from opening it multiple times.
So we DON'T enforce view count limits here - it's just not possible!

What we CAN do:
- Check if the file has expired ⏰
- Make sure they enter the right password 🔒

That's about it for client-side files!
